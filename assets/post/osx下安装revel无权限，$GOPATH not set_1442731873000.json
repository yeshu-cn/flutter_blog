{"title":"osx下安装revel无权限，$GOPATH not set","createTime":1442731873000,"updateTime":1442731944000,"category":"default","content":" \n  \n ##osx下安装revel无权限，$GOPATH not set \n  \n 1. 执行`go get github.com/revel/revel`错误，提示无权限 \n 2. 根据提示执行`sudo go get github.com/revel/revel`错误，提示没有$GOPATH not set \n 3. 然而已经在`~/.bash_profile`中设置了$GOPATH \n  \n ``` \n localhost:golang yeshu$ go get github.com/revel/revel \n # cd .; git clone https://github.com/revel/revel /Users/yeshu/code/golang/src/github.com/revel/revel \n Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo. \n package github.com/revel/revel: exit status 69 \n  \n localhost:golang yeshu$ sudo go get github.com/revel/revel \n Password: \n package github.com/revel/revel: cannot download, $GOPATH not set. For more details see: go help gopath \n  \n localhost:golang yeshu$ echo $GOPATH \n /Users/yeshu/code/golang \n ``` \n  \n 还是老外的回答最好 \n  \n 1. 第一个无权限错误原因：You don't have write access to your GOPATH.  Typically you would set GOPATH=~/gocode or something \n 2. 第二个提示$GOPATH没设置原因：new environment is created when you \"sudo\" -- the root user does not have the GOPATH set.  (Also, you probably don't want to solve it in this way anyway)  \n  \n ##这里不是GOPATH目录没有写权限问题 \n `Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo. \n ` \n  \n 因为系统自动更新了xcode，所以需要打开xcode同意下新的条款。（mb，xcode更新管我什么事情） \n  \n 解决方案： \n  \n * 命令行执行`sudo xcodebuild -license`同意条款 \n * 打开xcode同意一下 \n  \n 参考：  \n   \n * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/revel-framework/pWF3Cbm9cCI \n * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26197347/agreeing-to-the-xcode-ios-license-requires-admin-privileges-please-re-run-as-r"}
